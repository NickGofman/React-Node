// we need multiple connections to execute queries in parallel

// we may want to consider using a connection pool. Keeping a few connections open and pulling a free connection out of the pool when you need it will be more efficient than opening and closing a new connection for each request.

//   mysql.createPool is a place where connections get stored. it handles multiple connections.
// When you request a connection from a pool,you will receive a connection that is not currently being used, or a new connection.
// If youâ€™re already at the connection limit, it will wait until a connection is available before it continues.
